# HTML and CSS exercises

## Months

Take a look at the table below. Youâ€™re probably used to organizing data this way but for this exercise, you must convert it to an object. Name the object `months`.

| Month Number | Month Abbreviation | Month Name | Month Days Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Jan | January | 31 |
| 2 | Feb | February | 28 |
| 3 | Mar | March | 31 |
| 4 | Apr | April | 30 |
| 5 | May | May | 31 |
| 6 | Jun | June | 30 |
| 7 | Jul | July | 31 |
| 8 | Aug | August | 31 |
| 9 | Sep | September | 30 |
| 10 | Oct | October | 31 |
| 11 | Nov | November | 30 |
| 12 | Dec | December | 31 |

After you have created the object, log the following values to the console.

- the number of days in September
- the abbreviation for February
- what the name of the fourth month is

## Students

Use HTML and CSS to show a list of at least ten students in the browser. Apply a color of your choice to the first three students. Be sure to use semantic markup and to give a main heading to the list (e.g. Chemistry 101).

## Finances

Show a list of at least seven financial transactions in the browser, each of which has the following details on the same line.

- Name of the vendor
- Amount
- Category (e.g. dining, entertainment)

You need to consider the structure to make this work. One way to do this is to use several `<span>` elements within a single `<div>` element. This single element would comprise one transaction.

To finish this out, alternate the background so that the odd-numbered lines have a light-gray background while the even-numbered ones remain unchanged. Use `background-color: #ddd` for the light-gray.
