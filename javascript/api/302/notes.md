# Api 302

## we use HTTP verbs to describe API requests and nouns to refer to the data they handle.

### HTTP verbs

There are four verbs. Together, we sometimes refer to what they do as _CRUD_ operations.

- create
- read
- update
- delete

### Nouns

These describe the data and are usually preceded by a `/`. Examples below.

- `/contacts`
- `/users`
- `/photos`
- `/countries`
