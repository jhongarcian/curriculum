# API 303

## There are many different types of HTTP requests but you will mainly deal with just five of them

### Common HTTP request

**`DELETE`**
To delete data

**`GET`**
to retrive data

**`PATCH`**
to update data by overwriting only a part of a larger data set

**`POST`**
to create new data

**`PUT`**
to update data by overwriting everything in the data set

NOTE: _`PATCH`_ and _`PUT`_ are similar but our pratices will concentrate on _`PUT`_
