# Javascript Data 102
## Three simple data types.

### string
strings are defined with `'` or `"`.
```
let locaation = 'Atlanta, Georgia';
```

### boolean
The value of a boolean is either `true` or `false`.
```
const isNew = false;
```

### number
Pretty straighforward but `number` cannot write really, really big numbers.
```
let age = 32;
```
